# Links

Links are the glue holding the web together, so make sure you understand how to properly link to external websites AND internal files. An internal link is a type of hyperlink on a webpage to another page or resource, such as an image or document, on the same website or domain. Hyperlinks are considered either "external" or "internal" depending on their target or destination. Generally, a link to a page outside the same domain or website is considered external, whereas one that points at another section of the same webpage or to another page of the same website or domain is considered internal.

## Points to Ponder

* What's the difference between internal links (/somepage) and external links (http://www.somesite.com/somepage)?
* When on a webpage should you use the full URI (with the `http://yoursite.com/somepath`) and when should you use the relative path (`/somepath`)?
* How do you navigate the document tree with links (../../someotherpage)?
* How do you open links in external windows?
* What are all the possible pseudo-states (e.g. `:hover`) of a link and when are they actually activated?  How do you change styles based on them?

## Your Assignment
