# Ordered and Unordered Lists

Ordered and unordered lists are heavily used in most websites.  It's not just for bullet-points and numbers... they are also used in creating horizontal navbars and long collections of objects (like a list of pictures of items for sale).  They often take the place of tables as the method of choice for displaying structured content.

Lists are good from a structural point of view as they help create a well-structured, more accessible, easy-to-maintain document. They are also useful for a purely practical reason â€” they give you extra elements to attach CSS styles to, for a whole variety of styling (we'll get on to CSS later in the course - check out the Styling lists and links first, and then visit the [Web Standards Curriculum] table of contents for the full list of CSS articles available.

## Points to Ponder
